SPECTRUM CHALLENGE
As Cyberhunter, I will conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the USB thumb drive found on the
suspect to uncover details about the upcoming drug deal. My approach will involve examining the
drive's file system for potential evidence, recovering any deleted files, and analyzing the content of
documents, images, and communications. I will look for keywords, timestamps, and location data to
piece together information about when and where the deal is expected to occur. By extracting and
scrutinizing metadata and hidden content, I aim to provide Scotland Yard with critical insights to aid in
their investigation and potentially prevent the deal from going down.
